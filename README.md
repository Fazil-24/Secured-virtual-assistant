In the existing voice assistants, the proper authentication of the user for security purposes is not precise. Inculcating the face and voice bio-metrics will add up security for the system. To ensure each userâ€™s data and personal information is properly maintained, we provide double authentication. Also, a lot of time is spent on the tedious repetitive tasks, so we have automated it using voice assistant.
